## Development Workflow
1. Identify the issue you will be working on, if one doesn't exist please create one. Feel free to use the template from above.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to this repo.
3. Make sure you're on the main branch.
4. Run the following command `git pull`.
5. Create a new branch and switch to it `git checkout -b <branch-name>`. Example branch-name `fb-1`, where fb stands for feature branch and 1 represents the issue you are working on.
6. Now that you're on your feature branch you can start working on your code changes!
7. Once you have finished with your code changes, build the entire package and make sure existing and new unit tests are passing. This will ensure that we are not introducing any unknown errors.
8. Push your code `git push`, since you're on a different branch your terminal will actually prompt you with another command that will look similar to this `git push --set-upstream` use this.
9. Navigate to the repo on github.
10. You will now be prompted to create a pull-request, do this.
11. For the description of the PR feel free to just link the issue you were working on and if possible explain how you have verified that your code changes work (i.e. a screenshot, passing unit tests, etc).
12. Once you're ready create the PR and wait for at least 1 person to take a look at it before merging (we don't have to stick to this but it's good practice and it'll help us from making dumb mistakes).
